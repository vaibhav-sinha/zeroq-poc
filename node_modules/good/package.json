All of these events, _except_ 'ops' and 'wreck',  map to a hapi event documented [here](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#server-events).\n- `ops` - System and process performance - CPU, memory, disk, and other metrics.\n- `response` - Information about incoming requests and the response. This maps to either the \"response\" or \"tail\" event emitted from hapi servers.\n- `log` - logging information not bound to a specific request such as system errors, background processing, configuration errors, etc. Maps to the \"log\" event emitted from hapi servers.\n- `error` - request responses that have a status code of 500. This maps to the \"request-error\" hapi event.\n- `request` - Request logging information. This maps to the hapi 'request' event that is emitted via `request.log()`.\n- `wreck` - Wreck module request/response logging information.  Note: Wreck has to be in the top level package.json in order for this to work due to it being a singleton.\n\nApplications with multiple server instances, each with its own monitor should only include one _log_ subscription per destination\nas general events are a process-wide facility and will result in duplicated log events. To override some or all of the defaults,\nset `options` to an object with the following optional settings:\n\n- `[httpAgents]` - the list of `httpAgents` to report socket information about. Can be a single `http.Agent` or an array of agents objects. Defaults to `Http.globalAgent`.\n- `[httpsAgents]` - the list of `httpsAgents` to report socket information about. Can be a single `https.Agent` or an array of agents. Defaults to `Https.globalAgent`.\n- `[requestHeaders]` - determines if all request headers will be available to `reporter` objects. Defaults to _false_\n- `[requestPayload]` - determines if the request payload will be available to `reporter` objects. Defaults to _false_\n- `[responsePayload]` - determines if the response payload will be available to `reporter` objects. Defaults to _false_\n- `[opsInterval]` - the interval in milliseconds to sample system and process performance metrics. Minimum is _100ms_. Defaults to _15 seconds_.\n- `[responseEvent]` - the event type used to capture completed requests. Defaults to 'tail'. Options are:\n    - 'response' - the response was sent but request tails may still be pending.\n    - 'tail' - the response was sent and all request tails completed.\n- `[extensions]` - an array of [hapi event names](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi/blob/master/API.md#server-events) to listen for and report via the good reporting mechanism. Can not be any of ['log', 'request-error', 'ops', 'request', 'response', 'tail']. **Disclaimer** This option should be used with caution. This option will allow users to listen to internal events that are not meant for public consumption. The list of available events can change with any changes to the hapi event system. Also, *none* of the official hapijs reporters have been tested against these custom events. Also, the schema for these events can not be guaranteed because the hapi results can change.\n- `[reporters]` - Defaults to *no* reporters. All reporting objects must be installed in your project. `reporters` is an array of instantiated objects that implement the good-reporter interface or an object with the following keys:\n    - `reporter` - indicates the reporter object to create. Can be one of two values\n        - a constructor function generally via `require`, ie `require('good-file')`\n        - a module name to `require`. Uses the built-in Node `require` function so you can pass a module name or a path. The supplied module must implement the good-reporter interface.\n    - `events` - an object of key value pairs:\n        - `key` - one of the supported good events or any of the `extensions` events that this reporter should listen for\n        - `value` - a single string or an array of strings to filter incoming events base on the event's `tag` value. \"\\*\" indicates no filtering. `null` and `undefined` are assumed to be \"\\*\"\n    - `config` - an implementation specific configuration value used to instantiate the reporter\n- `[filter]` - an object with the following keys:\n    - `key` - the key of the data property to change\n    - `value` - a string that can be one of the following:\n        - \"censor\" - replace the text with \"X\"s\n        - \"remove\" - `delete`s the value\n        - a valid regular express string. Only supports a single group. Ex: `\"(\\\\d{4})$\"` will replace the last four digits with \"X\"s. Take extra care when creating this string. You will need to make sure that the resultant RegExp object is what you need.\n\n    `filter` can be used to remove potentially sensitive information (credit card numbers, social security numbers, etc.) from the log payloads before they are sent out to reporters. This setting only impacts `response` events and only if payloads are included via `requestPayload` and `responsePayload`. `filter` is intended to impact the reporting of ALL downstream reporters. If you want filtering in only one, you will need to create a customized reporter. The filtering is done recursively so if you want to \"censor\" `ccn`, anywhere `ccn` appears in request or response bodies will be \"censor\"ed. Currently, you can only filter leaf nodes; nothing with children.\n\n## Example Usage\nFor example:\n\n```javascript\nvar Hapi = require('hapi');\nvar server = new Hapi.Server();\nserver.connection({ host: 'localhost' });\n\nvar options = {\n    opsInterval: 1000,\n    reporters: [{\n        reporter: require('good-console'),\n        events: { log: '*', response: '*' }\n    }, {\n        reporter: require('good-file'),\n        events: { ops: '*' },\n        config: './test/fixtures/awesome_log'\n    }, {\n        reporter: 'good-http',\n        events: { error: '*' },\n        config: {\n            endpoint: 'http://prod.logs:3000',\n            wreck: {\n                headers: { 'x-api-key' : 12345 }\n            }\n        }\n    }]\n};\n\nserver.register({\n    register: require('good'),\n    options: options\n}, function (err) {\n\n    if (err) {\n        console.error(err);\n    }\n    else {\n        server.start(function () {\n\n            console.info('Server started at ' + server.info.uri);\n        });\n    }\n});\n\n```\n\nThis example does the following:\n\n1. Sets up the [`GoodConsole`](https://github.com/hapijs/good-console) reporter listening for 'request' and 'log' events.\n2. Sets up the [`GoodFile`](https://github.com/hapijs/good-file) reporter to listen for 'ops' events and log them to `./test/fixtures/awesome_log` according to the file rules listed in the good-file documentation.\n3. Sets up the [`GoodHttp`](https://github.com/hapijs/good-http) reporter to listen for error events and POSTs them to `http://prod.logs:3000` with additional settings to pass into `Wreck`\n\nNOTE: Ensure calling `server.connection` prior to registering `Good`. `request` and  `response` event listeners are only registered on connections that exist on `server` at the time `Good` is registered.\n\nLog messages are created with tags. Usually a log will include a tag to indicate if it is related to an error or info along with where the message originates. If, for example, the console should only output error's that were logged you can use the following configuration:\n\n```javascript\nvar options = {\n    reporters: [{\n        reporter: require('good-console'),\n        events: { log: ['error', 'medium'] }\n    }]\n};\n```\n\nThis will now _only_ log 'log' events that have the 'error' _or_ 'medium' tag attached to them. Any 'log' events without one of those tags will be ignored. Please see the documentation of the [good-reporter](https://github.com/hapijs/good-reporter) interface for more information about tags and event filtering.\n\n## Event Payloads\n\nEach event emitted from Good has a unique object representing the payload. This is useful for three reasons:\n\n1. It provides a predictable interface.\n2. It makes tracking down issues with MDB much easier because the payloads aren't just generic objects.\n3. It is more likely to be optimized because the V8 runtime has a better idea of what the structure of each object is going ot be much sooner.\n\n**All** of the below events are frozen to prevent tampering. If your reporter uses \"strict mode\", trying to change the value will throw an error.\n\n### `GreatLog(event)`\n\nEvent object associated with 'log' events. The `event` argument is the `event` argument emitted by hapi 'log' events.\n\n- `event` - 'log'\n- `timestamp` - JavaScript timestamp indicating when the 'log' event occurred.\n- `tags` - array of strings representing any tags associated with the 'log' event.\n- `data` - string or object passed via `server.log()` calls.\n- `pid` - the current process id.\n\n### `GreatError(request, error)`\n\nEvent object associated with 'error' events. `request` and `error` are the objects sent by hapi on 'request-error' events.\n\n- `event` - 'error'\n- `timestamp` - JavaScript timestamp indicating when the 'log' event occurred.\n- `id` - request id.

Each value contains the name of the socket used and the number of open connections on the socket. It also includes a `total` for total number of open http sockets.\n        - `https` - socket information https connections. Each value contains the name of the socket used and the number of open connections on the socket. It also includes a `total` for total number of open https sockets.\n\n### `GreatRequest(request, event)`\n\nEvent object associated with the \"request\" event.

Used for error reporting\n- An `init` method with the following signature `function init (readstream, emitter, callback)` where:\n    - `readstream` - the incoming [readable stream](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) from good. This stream is always in `objectMode`.\n    - `emitter` - the good event emitter. The `emitter` will emit the following events:\n    - `stop` - always emitted when the hapi server is shutting down. Perform any tear-down logic in this event handler\n\n```javascript\nvar Squeeze = require('good-squeeze').Squeeze;\n\nfunction GoodReporterExample (events, config) {\n\n    if (!(this instanceof GoodReporterExample)) {\n        return new GoodReporterExample(events, config);\n    }\n\n    this.squeeze = Squeeze(events);\n}\n\nGoodReporterExample.prototype.init = function (readstream, emitter, callback) {\n\n    readstream.pipe(this.squeeze).pipe(process.stdout);\n    emitter.on('stop', function () {\n\n        console.log('some clean up logic.');\n    });\n    callback();\n}\n\nGoodReporterExample.attributes = {\n    name: 'good-reporter-example'\n}\n```\n",
